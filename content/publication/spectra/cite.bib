abstract  ="State-of-the-art identification of the functional groups present in an unknown chemical entity requires the expertise of a skilled spectroscopist to analyse and interpret Fourier transform infra-red (FTIR){,} mass spectroscopy (MS) and/or nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) data. This process can be time-consuming and error-prone{,} especially for complex chemical entities that are poorly characterised in the literature{,} or inefficient to use with synthetic robots producing molecules at an accelerated rate. Herein{,} we introduce a fast{,} multi-label deep neural network for accurately identifying all the functional groups of unknown compounds using a combination of FTIR and MS spectra. We do not use any database{,} pre-established rules{,} procedures{,} or peak-matching methods. Our trained neural network reveals patterns typically used by human chemists to identify standard groups. Finally{,} we experimentally validated our neural network{,} trained on single compounds{,} to predict functional groups in compound mixtures. Our methodology showcases practical utility for future use in autonomous analytical detection."}
