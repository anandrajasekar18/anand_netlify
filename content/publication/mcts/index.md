abstract: One challenging and essential task in biochemistry is the generation of novel molecules with desired properties. Novel molecule generation remains a challenge since the molecule space is difficult to navigate through, and the generated molecules should obey the rules of chemical valency. Through this work, we propose a novel method, which we call unitMCTS, to perform molecule generation by making a unit change to the molecule at every step using Monte Carlo Tree Search. We show that this method outperforms the recently published techniques on benchmark molecular optimization tasks such as QED and penalized logP. We also demonstrate the usefulness of this method in improving molecule properties while being similar to the starting molecule. Given that there is no learning involved, our method finds desired molecules within a shorter amount of time.
